## introduction 

This is the practice for solving problem on leetcode

[leetcode problem of running sum of 1d array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)

## problem description

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

## my solutions design

according to the problem description

I would like to the property

runningSum[i] =  runningSum[i-1] +nums[i]

thus, I would use a accumulater  to calculate the  element of each runningSum[i] when loop nums
